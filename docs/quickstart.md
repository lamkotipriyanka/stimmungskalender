# Quickstart with a release

This section covers a quick set up that is not suitable for production use.

On debian based systems, you need the package `python3-venv`.

Download the latest release from [GitHub](https://github.com/rain0r/stimmungskalender/releases) or get the latest source code via `git`:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rain0r/stimmungskalender.git
```

Then execute `scripts/quickstart.sh`.

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000/` and log in with the user you just created.
